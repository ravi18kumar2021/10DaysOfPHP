Q. What is an abstract class?
>> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods and concrete methods.

Q. Why do we use abstract classes?
>> To provide a base class with common behaviour while forcing child classes to implement specific methods.

Q. What is an interface?
>> An interface defines a contract that a class must follow. It contains only method declarations. E.g. Payment gateways, logging systems, notification services, database drivers.

Q. When should you use an interface?
>> When you want to define what a class must do, not how it does it.

Q. What is a trait?
>> A trait is a mechanism for code reuse that allows sharing methods between classes. It is used to solve the multiple inheritance problem and avoid code duplication. E.g. Logging, authentication helpers, utility methods.

Q. What is polymorphism?
>> Polymorphism allows different classes to implement the same method in different ways.

Q. What is dependency injection (DI)?
>> Dependency Injection is passing dependencies to a class instead of creating them inside the class. It reduces tight coupling, improves testability and makes code flexible.

Q. What is loose coupling?
>> Classes depend on abstractions (interfaces) instead of concrete implementations.

Q. What is tight coupling?
>> When a class directly depends on concrete class, making changes difficult.
