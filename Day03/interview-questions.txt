Q. What does 'HTTP is stateless' mean?
>> HTTP is stateless, meaning that the server doesn't remember the previous requests from the same client. Each request is independent unless state is maintained using cookies or sessions.

Q. What is a cookie?
>> A cookie is a small key-value pair stored in the user's browser. It is used for remembering user preferences, track sessions or analytics.

Q. What is a session?
>> A session stores user data on the server (usually in files or memory) and identifies the user using a session ID.

Q. Difference between session and cookie.
>> Session stored data on the server, whereas cookie stored data on the browser. Session is more secure than cookie. Session is used for authentication, whereas cookie is used for preferences.

Q. How does login work internally?
>> 1. User submits credentials.
   2. Server validates them
   3. Session is created
   4. User ID is stored in session

Q. How does PHP identify a user's session?
>> Using a unique session ID, usually stored in a cookie (PHPSESSID).

Q. Can sessions work without cookies?
>> Yes, but it's not recommended. Session ID can be passed via URL, which is insecure.

Q. What is session hijacking?
>> When an attacker steals a valid session ID and impersonates a user.

Q. How can you make sessions more secure?
>> Using HTTPS, regenerating session ID and set secure cookie flags.

Q. What is session fixation?
>> It is an attack where an attacker forces a user to use a known session ID. We can fix it by regenerating session ID after login.
