Q. How do you store passwords securely in PHP?
>> By using password_hash() function to hash passwords before sending them to store in the database.

Q. How do you verify a password during login?
>> Using password_verify() function

Q. Difference between hashing and encryption.
>> Hashing is one way whereas encryption is two-way. Hashing cannot be reversed whereas encryption can be decrypted. Hashing is used for passwords whereas encryption is used for data storage.

Q. What is SQL injection?
>> An attack where malicious SQL code is injected through user input to manipulate database queries.

Q. How do you prevent SQL injection in PHP?
>> By using PDO prepared statements with bound parameters.

Q. What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?
>> An attack where malicious JavaScript is injected into web pages through user input.

Q. How do you prevent XSS in PHP?

Q. What is CSRF?

>> Detailed errors can leak sensitive system or database information.

Q. What is HTTPS and why is it important?
>> HTTPS encrypts data in transit, protecting credentials from interception.

Q. What security measures do you take in login system?
>> Password hashing, prepared statements, session regeneration and input validation.

Q. What are the most common PHP security mistakes?
>> Storing plain-text passwords, using raw SQL queries, not validating input and no CSRF protection.
