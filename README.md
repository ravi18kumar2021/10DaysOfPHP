# PHP Backend Interview Preparation (10 Days)

This repository documents my **10-day structured preparation plan for a PHP backend development role (without frameworks like Laravel)**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Strengthen **core PHP fundamentals**
- Practice **backend-oriented problem solving**
- Prepare **interview-ready explanations**
- Build **day-wise mini projects** with clear learning progression

I already have prior experience with backend development (Python, Flask, Django), so this roadmap focuses on **PHP-specific execution, syntax, OOP, database handling, APIs and security**.
